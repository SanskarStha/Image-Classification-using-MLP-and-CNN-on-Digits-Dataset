# Image-Classification-using-MLP-and-CNN-on-Digits-Dataset
Developed and implemented an image classification pipeline using two different neural network architectures, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to classify handwritten digits from the Digits dataset. The project aimed to explore and compare the performance of these architectures for image classification task.
